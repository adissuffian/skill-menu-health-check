## Procedure

For each market (or specified markets), perform the following steps using browser automation (Playwright MCP tools):

### 1. Open Homepage

- Navigate to the market's stage URL from the table above.
- Wait for the page to fully load.
- Take a snapshot to confirm the homepage is displayed.

### 2. Select Order Type

- Look for **Pick Up** or **Delivery** option on the homepage.
- Click on one of them (prefer **Pick Up** as it typically requires less input).

### 3. Enter Location

- **If Pick Up**: Enter the postcode or suburb from the test data into the search field.
- **If Delivery**: Enter the full delivery address from the test data into the address field.
- Wait for search results to appear.

### 4. Select Address from Search Results

- From the search results dropdown/list, click on the first matching address or suburb.
- Wait for the store list to load.

### 5. Select a Store

- From the **"Select a Store"** list, click the first available store.
- Wait for the order time screen to appear.

### 6. Select Order Time

- Look for the **"Now"** or **"Later"** button.
- If **"Now"** is available, click it.
- If only **"Later"** is available:
  1. Select any available **Order Date** from the dropdown.
  2. Select any available **Order Time** from the dropdown.
  3. Click the **"Schedule for Later"** button.
- Wait for navigation to the menu page.

### 7. Verify Menu Status

- Take a snapshot of the resulting page.
- **Menu is UP** if: The menu page loads with food categories and items visible.
- **Menu is DOWN** if: An error page is displayed, the page fails to load, or an error message is shown.

## Reporting

After checking all requested markets, produce a summary table:

```
| Market | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| AU     | UP     |       |
| NZ     | DOWN   | Error: "Service unavailable" |
| ...    | ...    | ...   |
```

## Error Handling

- If a page fails to load within 30 seconds, mark the market as **DOWN** with a timeout note.
- If any step in the flow fails (e.g., no stores available, address not found), note the specific failure point.
- Continue checking remaining markets even if one fails.
- Take a screenshot on failure for debugging context.

## Important Notes

- These are **staging environment** URLs — they may require VPN or network access.
- Some markets may have different UI layouts or languages; adapt the flow accordingly.
- The browser tools will provide snapshots in accessibility-tree format — use these to identify buttons, inputs, and links.
